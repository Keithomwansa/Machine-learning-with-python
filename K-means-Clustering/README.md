# K-means-Clustering
K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.
For customer segmentation, K-means will partition your customers into mutually exclusive groups, for example, into 3 clusters. The customers in each cluster are similar to each other demographically.
Now we can create a profile for each group, considering the common characteristics of each cluster.
